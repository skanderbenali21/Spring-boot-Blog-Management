# Spring-boot-Blog-Management

"Spring Boot Blog Management" is a blog management application built using the Spring Boot framework. It is designed to provide a simple, yet powerful platform for creating and managing blog posts, while also providing some features like statistics, recommendations, search history, and an advanced ban system based on detecting bad words.

## Features

### Blog Management

The repository includes pre-built templates and components for creating and publishing blog posts, including support for images. Users can create, edit, and delete their own posts, also manage comments and reactions.

### Simple Statistics

The application provides simple statistics, such as the total number of posts and the number of comments for each post. This enables users to get a quick overview of their blog's performance.

### Recommendation with Search History

The application uses search history to provide personalized recommendations for users. It recommends posts based on the user's search history and the popularity of the posts.
